## 👋 About us
We specialize in full-stack development of tailor-made apps and platforms. Working with backend (TypeScript/Rust/Go), underlying infrastructure (AWS/Kubernetes), and frontend UI (React/Next.js). Creating custom solutions personalized for each client is our biggest motivation.

Our rich and modern toolstack allows us solving any tasks in a quick and efficient way. We prefer staying very close to the bleeding edge of the technology, but always within the range of reliability and stability.
